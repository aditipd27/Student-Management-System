# Student-Management-System

The Student Grade Calculator project appears to be a Java-based program designed to compute a student's grades based on their marks in multiple subjects. Below is a summary of its key features:

Key Functionalities:
Input for Subjects and Marks:

The program prompts the user to input the number of subjects.
It then collects marks for each subject in a loop.
Calculations:

Computes the total marks obtained across all subjects.
Calculates the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
Grade Assignment:

The program determines a grade based on the calculated average percentage. (The details of the grade logic appear further down in the code.)
Output:

Displays the total marks, average percentage, and the grade to the user.
Code Structure:
The program uses a Scanner object for user input, making it interactive.
Employs basic arithmetic operations and control flow (e.g., loops and conditional statements) for calculations.
Outputs results directly to the console.
